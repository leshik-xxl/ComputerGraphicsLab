Topic: Construction of the Bézier curve.
 
Purpose: to get acquainted with the methods of rasterization of Bezier curves in practical experience.
 
Problem statement: Software to implement algorithms for rasterization of the Bézier curve by any number of points (at least 4 m). Apply geometric transformations to the curve (rotation, scaling, reflection (reflection), transfer (shift)).
 
 
Tasks for laboratory work:
1. Set reference points.
2. Display the Bezier curve on the monitor screen.
3. Implement the specified geometric transformations.
